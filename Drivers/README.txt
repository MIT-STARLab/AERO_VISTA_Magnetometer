This folder contains python code which runs in the Raspbian operating system on a Raspberry Pi zero.
When implemented together with the ASP electronics design, this system captures data from the HMC1053 magnetometers
using the AD7771 for digitization.
The data generated from these drivers / API can be viewed with scripts in the associated data processing folder.
